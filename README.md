# Opensource-Real-time-collaborative-text-editor
Free Opensource Terminal ncurses, which is dedicated to real-time collaborative text editing for Raspberry Pi (with client and server). It is a fork of the original Hermes, with a bug fix of server.cpp. This can be compiled for 32 bits x86. The package has also the binaries for using directly with a raspberry pi, allowing to directly use it ;) thank you
